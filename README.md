## Prep

For this series on Substrate, we have the following directory structure for our project lessons:   

${HOME}/<your-path-to-a-place-to-gather-all-subtrate-stuff-plus-your-project-code/
  
    my-first-project/  
  
        my-first-client/
            client.js
        my-first-smart-contract/
            <here is where we will be for now>
